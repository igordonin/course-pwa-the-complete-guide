# About manifest.json

In this project, it lies in the public/src folder, but bear in mind that when publishing the project, the manifest.json's location is supposed to be the root of your web site.

## Reference

## Notes

In the course, he mentions we need to import the manifest in all our html files. (I should double check that).

```html
  <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
```
